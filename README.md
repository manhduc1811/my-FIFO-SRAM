# my-SRAM based on FIFO

* This work is done via the guides, the discussion with Prof. Yamin (https://yamin.cis.k.hosei.ac.jp/)
* When test and check the SRAM-FIFO module in his Book: "Computer Principles and Design in Verilog HDL", I found an issue with his code and report it to prof. Yamin.  
* Based on his guideline, I develop my sram-fifo module and verify it by some testbenchs. The final version is correct.
